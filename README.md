# The project is automatic script
Why do i write these scripts?
Becaues,I'm a Devops working in the Intel company.And everytime when i doing some project may change the different version of the python packages.It would takes me so many time to install the packages correct version.So i want to write some scripts help to deploy the environment more convenitent.
# Self introduction:
I am a beginner of Python and a self learner.If you have any question about my project welcome to describe in my blog.Thks very much.I am also a Python enthusiast.My wish is to use tools to change the world.
# How to use it?
You can deploy the scripts in your computer or server.And use python interpreter to run it.
such as: python3 automation_upgrade.py 
Write the version you want to install.You can also change the mirros pools in your contury.
Your attention is my biggest motivation for updating
